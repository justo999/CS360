While developing the Event-Tracking App, I aimed to address the needs of diverse users including busy professionals, students, event planners, and parents by providing a comprehensive tool for managing events and schedules. The app includes essential features such as a login screen for user authentication and account creation, a database grid screen for viewing and managing data, and an SMS permission screen for handling user notifications. These screens and features were designed with a user-centered approach, focusing on clear labeling, intuitive navigation, and effective data management to enhance usability and functionality.

During the coding process, I employed modular coding practices, integrated SQLite for database management, and implemented robust permission handling for SMS notifications. Testing with the Android Emulator revealed and allowed me to address various issues, ensuring the appâ€™s reliability and smooth operation. Overcoming challenges, such as integrating SMS permissions and creating a functional database shell, required innovative solutions and careful planning. This project helped my ability to handle complex functionalities and demonstrated my ability to create a well-rounded app that meets user needs effectively.
